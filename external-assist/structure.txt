1. Structure I’m assuming (based on your examples)

For each proposal, the model will generate:

A. Narrative proposal body (goes in “Comments / Proposal” area)

Using a consistent section layout:

Proposal Overview
Short intro summarizing who the client is and what you’re helping them do.

Primary Challenges (optional if you don’t send any)
Bullet list pulled from your discovery / meeting notes.

Our Recommended Plan
Short explanation of which package(s) you recommend and why (e.g., Marketing Machine, 828 Plan, Good Start Minimal).

Key Objectives
3–6 bullets framed as outcomes.

What’s Included
For each selected service, sub-sections with bullets, modeled after:

Good Start Minimal’s “Included Deliverables 1/2/3…” list. 

good-start-minimal-with-comments

Marketing Machine’s numbered “Meetings / Research and Analysis / Who You Are / Who You Help / How You Help / How You Tell the World / Making Sure It Works / Next Steps and Tools” list. 

marketing-machine-only-with-com…

828 Plan’s detailed breakdown of posts, blogs, SEO, ads, reporting, etc. 

marketing-machine-plus-828

Timeline (if relevant)
Short paragraph like “4–6 weeks, depending on feedback and approvals.” 

good-start-minimal-with-comments

Investment
Plain-language description of one-time strategy/brand fees + monthly retainers and payment splits, similar to your existing proposals.

Next Steps
2–4 simple steps (sign proposal, pay deposit, schedule kickoff, etc.).

Sign-off
Short closing in your voice (“All things good,” etc.).

B. Line-item copy for each service

For each selected package, return a short description that can be dropped into “Products & Services” line items, similar in length/tone to:

“A comprehensive monthly content marketing package includes 4 scheduled social posts, 1 written and posted blog…” 

828-only-with-comments

“You need a Marketing Machine – a system of formulas and frameworks that help who you are, who you help, how you help, and how to tell the world about it.”

You’ll control the prices / billing in your app; the model just writes the text.
